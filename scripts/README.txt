log4jdbc is built with Ant 1.10.x and JDK 1.8.x

The build.cmd file is useful for building both the jdbc 3 version (JDK 1.4) and
the jdbc 4 version (under JDK 1.6) under windows.  The javadoc.cmd file is
useful for building javadoc (requires the 3rd party ydoc tool)

NOTE: as of 2015-09-30 the jdbc 3 version has been removed - not all build
scripts may have been updated to reflect that.
